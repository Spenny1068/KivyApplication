ImportError: no valuable window provider found
-> broken for python 3, currently using python 2.7.14
-> needed to install Cython for kivy compilation
-> needed to install kivy dependancies

Permissions denied: /dev/input/event*
-> /dev/input/event is responsible for keyboard and mice input events
-> adding user to 'input' group solved problem
-> sudo usermod -a -G <group> <user> then re-login
