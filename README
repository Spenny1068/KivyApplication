A desktop/mobile cross platform game written in python using the Kivy framework. Similar in concept to the game Avalanche (http://www.addictinggames.com/action-games/avalanche.jsp)
The aim of the game is to control a character, dodge and use falling objects to gain height. 
A high height will result in a high score. This game is an ongoing side project to develop competency and skills in python and game development. 
Will eventually be playable on mobile, making use of the device's accelerometer and multi touch capabilities.


#### FLOW OF CODE ####
1. Spawn 3 blocks
2. init: self.ground, self.invisible, self.spawnBlock, self.blockCol = False, False, True, False
3. give it a random pos[0]
4. Check for collisions (call detectCollisions()). If there is one, reRoll self.pos[0]
5. For every block, b.update() is called 30 times per second

Check for collisions
5. detectCollisions() will set self.blockCol = TRUE if there is a collision, otherwise it will set it to FALSE

6. b.update() will always do self.pos[1] -= self.fallSpeed:
set fallSpeed = 0 and ground = TRUE if self.pos[1] < 0]
set fallSpeed = 0 if blockCol = TRUE
set invisible = TRUE if self.pos[1] < -self.size[1]

7. MarshmallowGame.update() will 
delete block from array if b.invisible
call addBlock() and set spawnBlock = FALSE if fallSpeed == 0 AND spawnBlock = TRUE



#### NOTES ####
ImportError: no valuable window provider found
-> broken for python 3, currently using python 2.7.14
-> needed to install Cython for kivy compilation
-> needed to install kivy dependancies

Permissions denied: /dev/input/event*
-> /dev/input/event is responsible for keyboard and mice input events
-> adding user to 'input' group solved problem
-> sudo usermod -a -G <group> <user> then re-login
-> note: 'whoami' will show user name

Switch to Macbook
-> Works for python3 only
